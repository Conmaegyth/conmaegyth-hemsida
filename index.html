                Subway is an American multi-national fast food restaurant franchise that primarily sells submarine sandwiches (subs),<br/>
                wraps, salads and beverages. Subway was founded by 17 year old Fred DeLuca and financed by Peter Buck in 1965 as Pete's Super Submarines in Bridgeport, Connecticut.<br/>
                The restaurant was renamed Subway two years later, and a franchise operation began in 1974 with a second restaurant in Wallingford, Connecticut.<br/>
                It has since expanded to become a global franchise. Subway serves an array of topping choices, allowing the customer to choose which toppings they want on their sandwich.<br/>
                The longtime Subway slogan, "Eat Fresh", is intended to indicate the fresh ingredients that are used in their sandwiches.<br/>
                It was the fastest-growing franchise in the world in 2015 and, as of June 2021, had 37,540 locations in more than 100 countries and territories.<br/>
                More than half its locations (21,796 or 58.1%) are in the United States.<br/>
                It also is the largest single-brand restaurant chain, and the largest restaurant operator, in the world.<br/>
                Its international headquarters are in Milford, Connecticut.<br/>

                McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue, serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries across 37,855 outlets as of 2018.<br/>
                They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand, and later turned the company into a franchise, with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona.<br/>
                In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers.<br/>
                McDonald's had its previous headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global headquarters to Chicago in June 2018. <br/>
                McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue, serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries across 37,855 outlets as of 2018.<br/>
                Although McDonald's is best known for its hamburgers, cheeseburgers and french fries, they feature chicken products, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts.<br/>
                In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food, the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit.<br/>
                The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. According to two reports published in 2018, McDonald's is the world's second-largest private employer with 1.7 million employees (behind Walmart with 2.3 million employees).<br/>
                As of 2020, McDonald's has the ninth-highest global brand valuation.<br/>

                Burger King (BK) is an American multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants.<br/>
                Headquartered in Miami-Dade County, Florida, the company was founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger King, a Jacksonville, Floridaâ€“based restaurant chain.<br/>
                After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties in 1954, its two Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton and James McLamore purchased the company and renamed it "Burger King".<br/>
                Over the next half-century, the company changed hands four times, with its third set of owners, a partnership of TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, taking it public in 2002.<br/>
                The new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes.<br/>
                3G, along with partner Berkshire Hathaway, eventually merged the company with the Canadian-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons, under the auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company named Restaurant Brands International.<br/>
                The 1970s were the "Golden Age" of the company's advertising, but beginning in the early 1980s Burger King advertising began losing focus. A series of less successful advertising campaigns created by a procession of advertising agencies continued for the next two decades. In 2003, Burger King hired the Miami-based advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B), which completely reorganized its advertising with a series of new campaigns centered on a redesigned Burger King character nicknamed "The King", accompanied by a new online presence. While highly successful, some of CP+B's commercials were derided for perceived sexism or cultural insensitivity. Burger King's new owner, 3G Capital, later terminated the relationship with CP+B in 2011 and moved its advertising to McGarryBowen, to begin a new product-oriented campaign with expanded demographic targeting<br/>
